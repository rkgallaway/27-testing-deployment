## Assignment
### Write Tests

### Deploy the application
* Create a new repository for your application at Github and connect your sandbox to it.

* You should now have a fully functional static build in the builds folder
* Do a manual deployment of the build folder contents to a new Bucket and Cloud at AWS
* Prepare an automated deployment through Cloud Formation
* Make sure that ‘aws.yml’ and ‘build’ are in your .gitignore, and then commit your code back to github to auto-deploy
### Submission Instructions
* Upload the completed README.md, with diagram to your Code Sandbox
* Submit a link to your fork of the application running at Code Sandbox with full test coverage
